    <p>“The various forms of education or ‘normalization’ imposed upon an individual consist in making him or her change points of subjectification, always moving towards a higher, nobler one in closer conformity with the supposed ideal. Then from the point of subjectification issues a subject of enunciation, as a function of a mental reality determined by that point. Then from the subject of enunciation issues a subject of the statement, in other words, a subject bound to statements in conformity with a dominant reality.”</p>     
    <h2 class="section-title">The Story of the Monkey King</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, on a faraway mountain, a magic stone split open and gave birth to a lively monkey. He became king of his fellow monkeys and dreamed of living forever.</p>

    <p>He could ride clouds, change shapes, and wield a golden staff. He is proud and bold.</p>

    <p>His tricks and pride got him in trouble with the mighty gods above. He flipped and flew and fought.</p>

    <p>After learning his lesson, the Monkey King found a new purpose. He helped a kind monk on a long, brave journey to the West. Through courage and kindness, he became a true hero at last.</p>
